            <h2>Who is Gilbert Nkpulu </h2>
            <p> Hi, my name is Gilbert Nkpulu. I was born and raised in Nigeria before coming to the states when I was around 7 years old. My favorite food are pizza, cheeseburgers, and fries. Some of my hobbie include: playing basketball, singing, making music, and reading. Currently, I am attending Allstarcode's summer intensive where I actively learning different aspects of code everyday. I don't really know what I want to be when I grow up but I believe that learning code might help with my future decision and might also serve as a really essential tool in the future due to our world's continous advancement in technology. </p>
